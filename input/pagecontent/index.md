This CDA Example Library provides a curated collection of real-world CDA examples developed to support implementers and promote consistent use of CDA standards. Over the past decade, this library has grown organically through implementer-driven requests: when an implementer submitted a question or issue, the HL7 Structured Documents Work Group responded by creating an example to illustrate the correct or recommended approach.

Each example is designed to demonstrate best practices, resolve ambiguities, and clarify complex modeling scenarios using CDA. The examples reflect community priorities and evolving guidance, and they serve as practical resources for developers, vendors, and clinical system integrators.

This library remains a living resource. HL7 welcomes new example requests and is in the process of establishing a formal submission process to guide future contributions.
